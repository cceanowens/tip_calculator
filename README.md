# tip_calculator
This is Cassandra's Tip Calculator

This is an interactive tip calculator built on Python.
It's meant to be run from the terminal, and it prompts the user to enter 3 values: 
- The cost of the total meal
- The number of people present
- The tip percentage

The calculator will then display the total cost of the bill including the tip and 10% tax, as well as the amount each person should pay
(assuming they all split the bill evenly).

## How to run the program
After copying the repo in your machine, open a terminal/command prompt in the folder where the project is located.
Type: python tip_calculator.py
Enter the requested values for meal cost, number of people and tip percentage.
